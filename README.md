## Determining Which Doctorate Programs are Conducive to Fast Graduation Times Across Gender

Doctorate programs are large time investments, and for students who are trying to decide between different life science programs of study, time until graduation may be an important deciding factor. Clsuter analysis was performed for all doctorate programs at Duke University with regard to program, time to completion, and gender. Analysis shows that across the three clusters of doctorate programs related to their length of copmletion, men take significnalty shorter amounts of time to earn their degrees in programs that are relatively fast as well as those that take relatively longer amounts of time than others. 

## Which Doctorate Programs Would be Best for Men and Women Who Want to Start Working Sooner

Doctorate programs are typically advertised as requiring 4 years of work, but according to [this article](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/2019-08-12/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-phd-degree-and-should-you-get-one) the actual medial time to complete a doctorate program in the United States is 5.8 years, and often takes longer. For students who want to earn a doctorate degree but wish not to spend too much time on it, and who may want to move on with their lives by getting a job and finally earning an income, time to graduation can be a very important consideration when choosing a program. Additionally, as the average age of earning the degree is 33 years old, and is around the time many people consider having children, it would be valuable to see if there is a significant difference between the length of time for men and women to earn the degree.

## How to Analyze Public Data from Duke University 

Data was collected from the Duke University section of the [Next Generation Life Science Coalition](https://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/) website. Separate [raw PDFs](https://github.com/karinafrank/karinafrank-cluster_analysis_for_median_graduation_time_across_doctorate_programs_at_duke_university/tree/master/Raw%20Data%20Files) were downloaded with data on each individual life science PhD program offered. The data from PDFs was extracted and transformed into [Excel files](https://github.com/karinafrank/karinafrank-cluster_analysis_for_median_graduation_time_across_doctorate_programs_at_duke_university/tree/master/Raw%20Data%20Files) using [Tabula] (https://tabula.technology/). A new [data analysis Excel document]() was then created to perform cluster analysis using the following steps:


•	What kind of data was important to use to answer this question, how did you find it, and why did you use this information? Was there some data that you wish you had? If so, how would you change your approach?
•	What metrics did you think were important to understanding a quantitative answer to your original question and why? Did you “translate” any of your data into numbers?
•	Did you base your data analysis on another type of analysis or desired outcome?
•	Use website links to your data sources, for example, if you used data from Baltimore City Open Data, add a link for the reader to learn more.
